# Dotfiles for macOS

My personal configuration for setting up macOS computers.

## Format

This collection of dotfiles is organized according to the [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) format ([blog post](https://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html)).

## How to use

Either run `stow` directly, or ideally use the [mac-dev-playbook](https://github.com/idolize/mac-dev-playbook) Ansible playbook.
